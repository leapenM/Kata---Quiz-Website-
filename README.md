# Kata---Quiz-Website-
This was an interview assignment given by Direct Supply. A take-home Kata where I was tasked to develop an app utilizing an existing quiz API.

Within the program I developed a functioning quiz app with additional fronend elements(hints button and high score counter).

Directions: Create a web app, desktop app, or mobile app that allows the user to take a quiz on a topic of their choice. The app should fetch questions and answers from an external API, such as Open Trivia Database. The app should
also keep track of the user’s score and display feedback at the end of the quiz. If there is time remaining,
choose one of the following to take it further:
a. (Backend) Allow the user to create their own quizzes and share them with others, or
b. (Frontend) Add features such as timers, hints, and leaderboards to enhance the user experience.
